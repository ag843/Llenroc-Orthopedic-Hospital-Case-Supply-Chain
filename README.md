This README document outlines the objectives for the Llenroc Orthopedic Hospital (LOH) Inventory Analysis Project assigned to the analytics team. The Chief Analytics Officer, Nik Balk, has prepared an analysis task focused on the storage and usage of implants and components used in knee and hip replacement surgeries at LOH. Given the increasing number of these surgeries, there is a critical need to evaluate and possibly revise the inventory management policy to optimize storage space and efficiency.

**Objective**
The main objective of this project is to analyze the usage data of implants and components over the past two years to help LOH address space constraints and improve inventory management. The analysis will support strategic decisions regarding inventory policies, specifically comparing the current Periodic Automatic Replenishment (PAR) policy with a proposed Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory approach.
